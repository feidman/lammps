Tasks for Exercise info

Goals: Search effectively for info on the LAMMPS website, in the
LAMMPS manual, and via Google.

These tasks can all be done in your browser.  It will help to
set up these 3 bookmarks, so that you can one-click to these pages:

LAMMPS website: https://www.lammps.org/
LAMMPS manual: https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html
LAMMPS commands: https://docs.lammps.org/Commands_all.html 

The Firefox browser in the Virtual Box image has these bookmarks set,
but it will likely be nicer and quicker to do these tasks directly in
whatever browser you normally use.

-------------------
-------------------

(1) Use the LAMMPS website

For these sub-tasks use the main menu at the top of the website.

(a) Does LAMMPS have a Stillinger-Weber potential ?
    Hint: Use MD -> LAMMPS glossary

(b) Find LAMMPS methods for computing viscosity
    Hint: Use MD -> LAMMPS glossary

(c) What other LAMMPS tutorials exist ?

(d) Find papers by the Karniadakis group (Brown U) which cites LAMMPS

(e) Find papers on metallic glasses which cite LAMMPS

(f) Find 3rd party software tools which work with LAMMPS

(g) How do I post a message to the LAMMPS mail list ?

(h) How do I use the MatSci forum for LAMMPS ?

(i) Where are nice LAMMPS science movies I can watch ?

-------------------

(2) Use the User Guide portion of the LAMMPS manual

For these sub-tasks, start from the LAMMPS manual home page, which can
be reached from the website menu.

(a) How do I build LAMMPS from source code ?

(b) What command-line options does LAMMPS support ?

(c) How can I run multiple simulations from a single input script ?
    Hint: go to Section 8 in User Guide = Howto discussions

(d) How do I use the TIP4P water model in LAMMPS ?
    Hint: go to Section 8 in User Guide = Howto discussions

(e) What packages are available in LAMMPS and what do they do ?

(f) My simulation is getting an "Out of range atoms" error.  What does
    it mean?

-------------------

(3) Use the Programmer Guide portion of the LAMMPS manual

For this sub-task, start from the LAMMPS manual home page, which can
be reached from the website menu.

(a) How do I invoke LAMMPS as a library from another code, C/C++ or
    Python ?

-------------------

(4) Use the LAMMPS command webpage (inside the manual)

For these sub-tasks, start from the LAMMPS commands page which shows a
large table of command names.  It can be reached from the website
menu.

(a) Find the doc page for the units command

(b) What compute styles are available in LAMMPS ?

(c) Where are brief descriptions of all those computes ?

(d) What atom styles are avaiable in LAMMPS ?

(e) Find the doc page for the EAM pair style

-------------------

(5) Use Google search bars on the LAMMPS website

(a) Find LAMMPS website and doc pages related to the EAM pair style
    Hint: use the Google search bar on the LAMMPS home page

(b) Find LAMMPS papers about metallic glasses with Mg and Zn
    Hint: use the Google search bar on the LAMMPS home page

(c) Find LAMMPS mail list messages about the fix rigid command
    Hint: use the Google search bar on the LAMMPS Mail list page

-------------------

(6) Use Google directly

(a) Find the doc page for the LAMMPS units command

(b) Find the doc page for the compute cna/atom command

(c) Find mail messages about the fix rigid command
    Hint: include lammps-users in the search
